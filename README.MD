# Holidayro

## How to start application
To run the application, just press the "Run" button.

## How does it works

### After starting the application, the home page will be empty initially, so you need to register to gain access to the admin panel. Thanks to this, it will be possible to add holiday offers, which will then be displayed on the home page.

### Without registration, you can only book them by completing the booking form, provided that they have been added by the admin, and then make the payment.
Then the user has access to all his bookings in the "My reservations" tab.

### Adding a new offer in the admin panel:

In the case of the "Room" and "Board" fields, it is best to enter the information and separate the lines that you want to move to the new line with ";;"

After creating the hotel, edit it and fill in additional fields such as "Descriptions", "Attractions", "Photos url"

Each time, if we want to add another piece of information to a given field, press "Enter", for example:

Enter the text: "Outdoor swimming pool" in input, then press"Enter"
